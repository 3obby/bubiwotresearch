Abstract
BUBIWOT (Bitcoin-backed Universal Basic Income Web of Trust) introduces a novel decentralized identity
and account recovery protocol built on the Babylon protocol, integrating a novel cryptographic key recovery
scheme using CosmWasm smart contracts to create a decentralized web of trust. The protocol establishes a
sustainable economic model where token holders earn a share of protocol revenue in Bitcoin, and it powers
a decentralized, censorship-resistant social platform. It functions as a foundational Humanity-as-a-Service
layer for the entire decentralized web, enabling any application to verify human users, prevent Sybil attacks,
enabling socially-recoverable Bitcoin wallets, laying the foundation for inheritable digital estates, and powering a user-owned data economy. The protocol leverages real-life peer-to-peer (IRL) attestations to securely establish and recover accounts,
proving humanity through strong-form identity, and economically incentivizing truthful participation. This paper
provides a concise overview of the BUBIWOT architecture, its core functionalities, and the economic incentives
that underpin its security model.

Introduction

The BUBIWOT protocol is engineered to address crit-
ical challenges in decentralized identity management
and account security. By integrating real-world, in-
person verification with a robust cryptographic and
economic framework, BUBIWOT aims to provide a se-
cure, censorship-resistant, and user-centric system for
identity attestation and account recovery.

Overview

BUBIWOT is designed to achieve the following core
objectives:
• Facilitate in-real-life (IRL) peer-to-peer identity
attestations.
• Enable cryptographic, decentralized account re-
covery.
• Provide a user-controlled, socially-recoverable Bitcoin wallet via a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).
• Secure digital legacy through programmable, on-chain inheritance.
• Distribute Universal Basic Income (UBI) tokens
backed by staked Bitcoin.
• Provide a yield-bearing native token (BUBI) that
captures a share of network fees.
• Enable a decentralized, value-ranked content and
communication platform.
• Ensure robust security and censorship resistance.
• Provide economic incentives to foster honest par-
ticipation and disincentivize malicious behavior.

Technical Architecture

The BUBIWOT ecosystem is a self-hosting stack de-
signed for sovereignty, where users govern the proto-
col's evolution. It is composed of four primary, inter-
connected layers:

1. The BUBIWOT Appchain: A sovereign, application-
specific blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK
and secured by Bitcoin via the Babylon proto-
col. It serves as the ultimate settlement layer,
hosting core modules for accounts, governance,
and CosmWasm smart contracts, and features an
encrypted mempool to mitigate front-running.
2. The Smart Contract Layer: The logical core
of the protocol, built with CosmWasm in Rust.
These contracts form the on-chain "constitution,"
managing user identity (the bubi-hub), a robust
governance module with private ZK-voting, a de-
veloper economy with staked code reviews, and
an ENS-like on-chain registry (resolver-contract)
that maps human-readable names to decentral-
ized infrastructure endpoints.
3. The In-Browser P2P Client: The primary gateway
to the ecosystem is a mobile-first, browser-based
client that establishes a secure user session. Built
with web technologies (TypeScript, CosmJS, LibP2P,
Nostr), it delivers a sovereign wallet and identity
manager with the simplicity of a modern web
app. The client abstracts away key management
complexity, presenting the user with a clean dash-
board to manage their wallet, a visual "Recovery
Health" score for their social recovery setup, and a
social hub. It orchestrates communication across
three distinct layers: an Appchain Service for on-
chain transactions, a Nostr-based Social Service
for discovery and signaling, and a LibP2P-based
Private Service for secure, end-to-end encrypted
data exchange like recovery shares.
4. Off-Chain Validator Services: Critical infras-
tructure operated by the appchain's validators
and other permissionless actors. Their role is
expanded beyond consensus to include hosting
the commons: operating a Threshold Signature
Scheme (TSS) for the Bitcoin treasury, pinning
the protocol's source code and user content on
decentralized storage, and running services for
verifiable builds and on-chain auctions, creating
a fully self-sustaining ecosystem.

### 3.1 Account Status Lifecycle  (NEW)

To protect governance from Sybil influence the protocol recognises three canonical
account states:

| State    | Requirements                              | Permissions |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Fresh**  | Key registered, no peer attestation      | Wallet ops only |
| **Attested** | ≥ 1 `PeerVerificationRecord` **and** ≥ 1 active verified device | Full feature set (UBI, proposals, voting, reviews, guardian duties) |
| **Frozen** | Attested account whose devices are inactive past `DEVICE_HEARTBEAT_GRACE` **or** flagged by guardian/watchtower quorum | Custody only (no UBI, no governance) |

State transitions are enforced on-chain; e.g. `create_proposal`, `register_builder`
and `claim_ubi` all assert the **Attested** state.

### 3.2 Trust-Chain Analytics  (NEW)

Every peer attestation adds an edge to the on-chain social graph **G(V,E)**.  
Exposing graph-derived, ZK-verifiable metrics unlocks:

* *Shortest-path proofs* – e.g. "Prove I'm ≤ 3 hops from @another_user."  
* *Personalised PageRank* – continuous trust scores (`τ_u(v) ∈ [0,1]`) that dApps can
  consume without learning the raw neighbourhood.  
* *Spam attenuation & rate-limiting* based on trust mass.  
* *Delegated voting weight* or quadratic funding modifiers derived from τ values.  

The heavy computation runs off-chain; users publish only a Merkle commitment to
their local trust vector and supply lightweight ZK proofs when needed.

Account Recovery via Bottom-Up Secret Sharing

The account recovery process is redesigned around a
powerful cryptographic primitive known as Bottom-Up
Secret Sharing (BUSS), as detailed in the ANARKey
paper. This eliminates complex on-chain state man-
agement for recovery sessions, moving the interactive
parts of the process off-chain. While the direct ex-
change of cryptographic shares between a user and
their guardians occurs over a secure peer-to-peer net-
work, the process fundamentally relies on the BUBIWOT
smart contract as a public bulletin board to store es-
sential recovery data. This hybrid approach streamlines
recovery into a secure and efficient two-phase process: a
one-time backup and a recovery phase.

4.1

Phase 1: One-Time Key Backup

This is an off-chain setup process performed by the
user's client to generate and store public recovery data.
1.  **Guardian Selection:** The user selects a set of guardians and a recovery threshold (`t+1`) in their client.
2.  **Off-Chain Share Generation:** The user's client requests a "share" from each guardian over the P2P network. Each guardian's client uses its own secret key to deterministically compute a unique share for the user and sends it back. Guardians do not store this share.
3.  **Public Data Creation:** The user's client combines its own secret key with the shares from its guardians to define a secret polynomial. It then computes a set of public points from this polynomial. This is the **public recovery data**.
4.  **On-Chain Storage:** The user submits a sin-
gle transaction to store this public recovery data
in the BUBIWOT smart contract, permanently
linking it to their account.

4.2

Phase 2: Account Recovery

When a user loses their device, they use their new de-
vice to perform the following off-chain reconstruction.
1.  **Data Retrieval:** The user's client fetches the
public recovery data from the smart contract.
2.  **Share Re-computation:** The user contacts the
required threshold of guardians (`t+1`). The guardians
perform the exact same deterministic computa-
tion as before to re-generate the exact same shares
and send them to the user.
3.  **Key Reconstruction:** The user's client com-
bines the public data points with the newly re-
ceived guardian shares. This is enough informa-
tion to perfectly reconstruct the original secret
polynomial and compute the original secret key.
The user's account is now recovered without any
complex on-chain voting or session management.
Crucially, this also restores full control over any Bitcoin held in the user's optional, protocol-managed sovereign vault.

Cryptographic and Economic
Foundations

The security of the BUBIWOT protocol rests on sev-
eral key pillars:
• IRL Web of Trust: The protocol is founded on
an economic web of trust. Security doesn't rely
on technically proving an in-person meeting, but
on the principle that guardians are economically
liable for their attestations. This foundation sup-
ports a novel Bottom-Up Secret Sharing scheme,
allowing for cryptographic key backup among trusted,
dynamically managed peers. To prevent cas-
cading failures (the "domino effect" where
recovering one user's key could lead to the
compromise of another), users who choose
to act as guardians use a dedicated, sep-
arate "guardian key" for recovery opera-
tions. This isolates a user's guardian du-
ties from their personal account key. This
advanced security architecture is managed
seamlessly by the BUBIWOT client, which
abstracts away the complexity of handling
multiple keys. For the user, the experi-
ence remains simple and unified, without
the burden of manually managing separate
keys. Loss of this guardian key does not
result in a loss of the user's own funds, but
it does prevent them from helping others
in recovery until the key is rotated or re-
covered.
• BUBIWOT Smart Contracts on a Sovereign
Appchain: The core logic runs in smart con-
tracts on the BUBIWOT Appchain, a sovereign
blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK. This ap-
pchain uses the Babylon protocol to anchor its
security to Bitcoin. The smart contracts func-
tion as a decentralized and immutable bulletin
board for storing the public recovery data re-
quired by the BUSS scheme, while also manag-
ing the protocol's economic incentives, on-chain
Sybil penalties, and content pointers for the so-
cial platform.
• Trust-Minimized BTC Distribution: The
protocol can programmatically distribute Bitcoin
rewards and network fees from a protocol-owned
vault. This vault is secured by a Threshold Sig-
nature Scheme (TSS) operated by the BUBIWOT
appchain's own validator set, removing single points
of failure and allowing smart contracts to safely
trigger BTC payouts.
• **Sovereign Bitcoin Custody:** Beyond staking, BUBIWOT offers users an optional, socially-recoverable Bitcoin wallet. This is achieved through a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) where the validator set manages key shares for a user-dedicated Bitcoin address. The private key is never held by any single entity. Spending authority is granted only by a valid transaction from the user's BUBIWOT account, effectively linking Bitcoin security to the user's robust, socially-recoverable BUBIWOT identity.
• **Evidence-Based, Composable Personhood:** BUBIWOT establishes a robust, scalable method for identity validation by treating identity as a collection of **verifiable evidence** rather than a single status. The protocol stores cryptographic proofs of identity-forming events directly on-chain, such as records of successful **peer attestations** (social verification) and a list of **hardware-bound device fingerprints** (hardware verification). This evidence-based model allows external applications to query for the specific proofs they require, answering not just *if* a user is a unique person, but *how* their uniqueness has been verified. UBI eligibility is gated on a combination of these proofs (e.g., requiring both peer and device verification), but the true power lies in the system's composability. This is coupled with a rich **identity vector** of atomic, on-chain metrics committed to a Merkle tree, allowing a user to generate ZK-proofs for any combination of facts (e.g., "Prove I have at least one verified device AND my developer reputation is > 50") without revealing unrelated data.
• Secure Software Supply Chain: The proto-
col ensures that users run community-approved
code through a trust-minimized deployment pipeline.
All software updates are subject to a staked gov-
ernance vote that bundles the source code com-
mit hash with a verifiable, deterministic build
hash of the client application. This single-proposal
process prevents drift between approved code and
deployed applications, and it is secured by a net-
work of bonded "builders" who are slashed for
submitting fraudulent builds.
• **The Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) as a Decentralized Central Bank and Chief Diplomat:** To ensure perpetual growth and long-term dominance, BUBIWOT does not simply distribute all its revenue. A governable portion is diverted to a protocol-owned Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). The SWF is not merely a treasury; it functions as the protocol's decentralized central bank and **chief diplomat**, actively managed by BUBI holders. Through `ExecuteSWFStrategy` governance proposals, the community can direct the protocol's TSS-controlled wallets to execute precise, cross-chain DeFi operations—such as providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges, staking assets in lending protocols, or making strategic investments. **Furthermore, governance can deploy SWF capital to execute trust-minimized token swaps with allied protocols, creating mutual skin-in-the-game, and can wield the voting power of its diverse assets in other DAOs, transforming BUBIWOT into an influential meta-governance player.** The yield generated from these activities is programmatically harvested and returned to the central treasury, creating a powerful compounding flywheel. This transforms the protocol from a passive recipient of fees into an active, capital-efficient engine for economic expansion, amplifying the value captured for all participants and creating a self-funding model for the UBI.

Economic Incentives

The economic model is designed to align participant
interests with the security and integrity of the network.
• Users stake Bitcoin on the L1 blockchain via the
Babylon protocol to participate.
• **Productive BUBI Token:** Holding BUBI tokens entitles the user to claim a proportional share of the network's accumulated Bitcoin fees, making it a productive, yield-bearing asset. **The protocol captures value from three primary streams: 1) BTC yield from Babylon staking rewards, 2) BUBI-denominated network fees, and 3) direct B2B revenue from the protocol's on-chain Humanity Oracle. The oracle's revenue model is tiered: it provides simple `is_human` checks for a base fee, and high-value, privacy-preserving attestations of specific user attributes (e.g., "prove reputation > 500") via ZK-proofs for a premium fee.** The first two streams of BUBI fees are converted into a distributable asset via a decentralized, on-chain batch auction system, periodically selling the accumulated fees for Bitcoin. The third stream consists of fees paid in foreign assets (e.g., ETH, USDC) by other protocols for oracle services. These foreign assets are added to the protocol treasury, enriching the value available to all BUBI holders. This creates a robust, self-sufficient economic loop without relying on external price oracles or centralized exchanges.
• **The Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF):** To ensure perpetual growth and long-term dominance, BUBIWOT does not simply distribute all its revenue. A governable portion of all incoming revenue (from both auctions and oracle fees) is automatically diverted to a protocol-owned Sovereign Wealth Fund. This SWF is an on-chain, actively managed investment vehicle. Through governance, BUBI holders can vote to deploy SWF capital into strategic initiatives, such as providing protocol-owned liquidity on decentralized exchanges, investing in promising new technologies, or acquiring assets that generate further yield for the protocol. **This also includes forming strategic alliances through token swaps and participating in the governance of other protocols, making the BUBI token a vehicle for meta-governance influence.** This transforms the treasury from a passive pot of funds into a powerful engine for economic expansion, creating a compounding value flywheel that benefits all participants.
• Guardian attestations are incentivized through
rewards in both Bitcoin and the protocol's native
token. **Beyond one-time attestation rewards, guardians are compensated for ongoing liveness and availability. Users can trigger periodic reward distributions to their active guardians, funded by a portion of network revenue, creating a durable incentive for maintaining a healthy and responsive recovery network.** Bitcoin rewards are distributed from a decentralized, protocol-owned vault controlled by the BUBIWOT validator set via a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).
• To deter malicious behavior, slashing penalties
are imposed on guardians who act dishonestly.
• **UBI is distributed via a user-initiated "pull" model. Verified humans can claim their accrued BUBI tokens at any time, which are newly minted upon claim. To ensure economic stability and a predictable emission schedule, the protocol implements a dynamic claim rate, limiting the total amount of UBI that can be claimed per period based on the overall network health and number of verified participants. This aligns token emission directly with active participation while preventing sudden inflation.**

Risk Analysis and Mitigation

BUBIWOT anticipates several potential threats and
proactively implements safeguards:

7.1

Collusion Among Guardian Peers

Threat: Multiple guardians might conspire to mali-
ciously control or recover a user's account.
Mitigation: Users set customizable multi-attestation
thresholds, a quorum of guardians for any critical ac-
tion. The cryptographic scheme ensures that fewer
than the threshold number of guardians have zero in-
formation about the user's key. Furthermore, the
risk of a cascading "domino effect" is mitigated
by having users who opt-in to be guardians use
a dedicated guardian key. This key separation
is an advanced security feature managed by the
client to prevent user burden while isolating a
guardian's duties from their personal account.
While loss of this key doesn't impact their own
funds, it is a critical piece of their participa-
tion in the social web of trust, and the protocol
provides a mechanism for its recovery and ro-
tation. The ability to dynamically replace guardians
via a time-locked transaction further reduces long-term
collusion risk.

7.2

Sybil Attacks

Threat: Malicious actors attempt to create numerous
fraudulent identities to manipulate UBI distribution.
Mitigation: The protocol features a two-level defense
system.
*   **Level 1: Automated On-Chain Penalties.** The protocol's primary defense is economic. By
requiring staked BTC and making guardians financially liable for their attestations, BUBIWOT
creates a powerful disincentive against approving fake accounts. Should a Sybil account be iden-
tified, it is automatically penalized on-chain by having its BUBI tokens confiscated and reputa-
tion destroyed. The guardians who attested for the Sybil are also penalized, reinforcing the web
of trust.
*   **Level 2: Bitcoin-Grade Consensus Security.** For catastrophic, large-scale attacks that
threaten the protocol's integrity, BUBIWOT inherits Bitcoin's security via the Babylon protocol. If malicious actors attempt to attack the BUBIWOT appchain itself (e.g., by double-signing blocks to revert penalties), their actions constitute a BFT consensus violation. Babylon's protocol is designed to detect such violations, which automatically reveals the attackers' private keys. This allows anyone to submit a transaction to the Bitcoin network to slash the attackers' staked Bitcoin, providing a crucial backstop that secures the BUBIWOT chain's state and its enforcement of penalties.

7.3

Loss of Devices or Keys

Threat: Accidental key loss jeopardizes user accounts
and staked funds.
Mitigation: Robust social recovery is achieved via the cryptographic **Bottom-Up Secret Sharing** scheme. By retrieving public data from the smart contract and collecting deterministic shares from a threshold of guardians, a user can securely reconstruct their original key on a new device. **To enhance user experience and mitigate disruption from single-device loss, the protocol also supports optional session redundancy through a device mesh.** A user can designate companion devices (e.g., a laptop and a phone), each holding limited-privilege session keys. If one device is lost, the remaining device(s) can initiate an ephemeral co-signing process to securely generate a new session for a replacement device, often without needing to perform a full social recovery. This provides a practical layer of fault tolerance that minimizes panic and disruption for non-technical users. **To reduce the friction of real-time coordination, the protocol supports an asynchronous share-provisioning mechanism. Guardians can periodically attest to their liveness by pre-authorizing encrypted recovery components, which can be stored ephemerally on a decentralized network. This allows a user in recovery to aggregate the necessary components without requiring every guardian to be simultaneously online.** Crucially, this recovered key is the same key that controls the user's staked Bitcoin on the L1, ensuring that the primary economic stake is protected by the social recovery mechanism. Furthermore, if the user has opted into a protocol-managed sovereign vault, recovering their BUBIWOT account seamlessly restores their control over the Bitcoin held within it, making BUBIWOT a single, resilient recovery point for their entire digital asset portfolio.

7.4

Guardian Unresponsiveness & P2P Disruption

Threat: A user's recovery may be stalled or blocked
if their guardians are offline, have lost their keys, or
refuse to cooperate.
Mitigation: The protocol implements a multi-layered
approach to ensure guardian availability.
*   **Proof-of-Liveness via Guardian Light Nodes:** To ensure guardians remain active and accountable, they are incentivized to run lightweight nodes that monitor the BUBIWOT appchain. Guardians periodically submit a signed "guardian heartbeat" transaction on-chain to prove their liveness. This provides a verifiable, economic signal of availability. Users can monitor the on-chain status of their guardians and are empowered to initiate a slashing transaction against a guardian who remains unresponsive for a predefined grace period, further securing the reliability of the recovery network.
*   **On-Chain Guardian Replacement:** A user
can initiate a formal, time-locked replacement
process on the BUBIWOT appchain at any time.
This provides a definitive, trust-minimized mech-
anism to maintain a healthy and active set of
guardians, ensuring recovery is always possible.
The time-lock ensures the existing guardian has
a window to observe the pending change.
*   **Guardian Key Management:** The protocol
includes a process for guardians to manage their
own dedicated guardian key. If a guardian loses
or wishes to rotate their key, they can initiate
an on-chain action, authorized by their primary
account key, to set a new guardian key. This en-
sures guardians can maintain their trusted sta-
tus and ability to help others without needing to
completely re-establish their social connections.
*   **Decentralized Social Platform with Sovereign Storage:** The protocol
powers a censorship-resistant social media ecosys-
tem. Users publish content (e.g., posts, replies)
to decentralized Nostr relays for real-time com-
munication. The BUBIWOT smart contracts store
immutable, on-chain pointers to this content.
For long-term persistence, users can pay a
fee to have content archived to a durable,
content-addressed storage layer operated by
the protocol's own validator set. This model
was chosen deliberately over existing solutions
like IPFS, which lacks direct economic in-
centives for storage, or Arweave, whose
permanent endowment model makes assump-
tions about the future cost of storage that
are difficult to justify. Instead, BUBIWOT
creates a direct, pay-as-you-go market for
data permanence, where user fees directly fund
the network of validators and pinning ser-
vices that guarantee storage. This unique hy-
brid design combines the speed of Nostr with the
verifiable durability of a simple, incentive-aligned
storage market, enabling a scalable social platform where
content can be ranked and filtered by value (do-
nated BUBI), creating a rich, user-curated atten-
tion economy.
• **Durable Identity and Reputation:** Users establish cryptographic proof-of-personhood through a combination of device-binding and peer-based attestations. This evidence-based identity supports decentralized access control, reputation building, and social recovery, enhancing digital sovereignty.
• **Inheritable Digital Estates:** BUBIWOT directly addresses the critical, unsolved problem of digital asset inheritance. The protocol provides tools for users to create a programmable "smart will," designating heirs and defining specific, on-chain conditions for asset succession. This applies not just to the BUBI account, but also to any Bitcoin held in the user's managed sovereign vault. This transforms a BUBIWOT account into a durable, inheritable digital legacy for a user's most valuable assets, creating the ultimate user lock-in and making the platform a prime venue for long-term, intergenerational value storage.
• **Sovereign Developer & App Ecosystem:** BUBIWOT fosters a vibrant ecosystem for its own
evolution and for trusted third-party applications. Any user can create a BUBI-
denominated bounty to fund new features
or bug fixes. Developers can then claim
these bounties via governance-approved code
proposals. **This same trust-minimized pipeline is used to power a "Sovereign App Store," where third-party apps can be submitted for community review and, upon passing a vote, are listed in an on-chain registry. Users can then interact with these apps through the BUBIWOT client, confident they are using legitimate, community-vetted software.** To secure this process, the sys-
tem includes staked code reviews and an
integrated bug bounty program. Review-
ers who approve code are rewarded but
are slashed if a bug is later discovered and
reported through governance by another
user. This rewards diligent reviewers, pe-
nalizes negligent ones, and creates a pow-
erful, objective, and incentive-aligned sys-
tem for advancing the codebase.
• **Real-Time Social Consensus and Attention
Economy:** The P2P client layer enables real-
time flagging and voting on peer interactions,
creating a dynamic social consensus layer. Users
can attach micropayments (in BUBI) to mes-
sages or actions to incentivize others' attention,
fostering a vibrant, responsive, and economically
sustainable social graph.
• **Humanity-as-a-Service: The ZK-OAuth Capability Protocol:** BUBIWOT's most powerful feature is its ability to serve as a decentralized, cross-chain oracle for programmable, human-centric capabilities. Any external dApp, DAO, or protocol can integrate with BUBIWOT to securely interact with provably unique human beings, effectively outsourcing Sybil resistance and high-stakes user authentication.
    *   **Mechanism**: A dApp on another chain (e.g., Ethereum) or a web service can construct a `CapabilityRequest`, defining a set of conditions (e.g., "user must have developer reputation > 500") and a desired permission (e.g., "sign this login message"). This request is published to the decentralized Nostr network, and a pointer to it is anchored on the BUBIWOT chain with a fee. The user's BUBIWOT client detects this request, and with a single tap, the user can generate a privacy-preserving ZK-proof to satisfy the conditions and authorize the capability. For high-security actions, the request can even require a threshold of the user's guardians to co-sign the approval off-chain, with all signatures bundled together for verification.
    *   **Revenue Generation**: The querying dApp pays a fee (e.g., in USDC) to the BUBIWOT treasury for this service, **with premium fees for more complex, high-value ZK-based queries or those requiring guardian interaction.** The BUBIWOT contract provides the immutable on-chain grant, while the user's client provides the cryptographic proof back to the dApp.
    *   **Use Cases**: This enables fair airdrops, one-person-one-vote DAO governance, and Sybil-resistant NFT mints. It unlocks advanced applications like undercollateralized lending based on reputation, secure multi-guardian-authorized access to DAO tooling, and powers a new, user-owned data economy. Verified humans can securely pool their private data to train AI models, earning revenue in a privacy-preserving way. This creates a constant, growing revenue stream and transforms BUBIWOT into an indispensable piece of infrastructure for the entire digital economy.

Tokenomics and Distribution

The economic sustainability of BUBIWOT is reinforced
through carefully structured tokenomics:
• Total Supply and Emission: A clearly de-
fined total supply with a predictable emission
model. New tokens are minted exclusively when
verified users actively claim their Universal Ba-
sic Income (UBI). This "pull" mechanism ensures
that supply expansion is directly tied to user en-
gagement. **To maintain stability, the emission rate is dynamically adjusted based on network growth and activity, ensuring a predictable and sustainable token supply.**
• Initial Distribution: Tokens are distributed
primarily through verified IRL attestations and
UBI claims, rewarding users for onboarding au-
thentic peers and actively participating in the
network.
• Incentives and Penalties: Guardians and val-
idators earn tokens for truthful participation, while
dishonest behavior is economically disincentivized
through slashing mechanisms tied directly to staked
Bitcoin collateral.
• Token Utility and Demand: The BUBI token
possesses deep utility. It functions as a medium
of exchange in the protocol's attention economy,
a reputation marker, and most importantly, a
yield-bearing asset that grants holders a claim
on the network's BTC-denominated fees. This
creates a powerful and sustainable demand driver.

Conclusion

The BUBIWOT protocol establishes an innovative and
decentralized framework for identity management. By
leveraging the security of the Bitcoin network, the trust
inherent in real-world relationships, and a system of in-
centivized human participation, BUBIWOT provides a
robust, scalable, and secure solution for identity vali-
dation. This positions it as a foundational technology
not only for global-scale UBI and decentralized identity, but also as a next-generation platform for making Bitcoin self-custody secure, recoverable, and accessible to everyone.
