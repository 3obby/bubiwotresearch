Abstract
BUBIWOT (Bitcoin-backed Universal Basic Income Web of Trust) introduces a novel decentralized identity
and account recovery protocol built on the Babylon protocol, integrating a novel cryptographic key recovery
scheme using CosmWasm smart contracts to create a decentralized web of trust. The protocol establishes a
sustainable economic model where token holders earn a share of protocol revenue in Bitcoin, and it powers
a decentralized, censorship-resistant social platform. The protocol leverages real-life peer-to-peer (IRL)
attestations to securely establish and recover accounts, proving humanity through strong-form identity, and
economically incentivizing truthful participation. This paper provides a concise overview of the BUBIWOT
architecture, its core functionalities, and the economic incentives that underpin its security model.

Introduction

The BUBIWOT protocol is engineered to address crit-
ical challenges in decentralized identity management
and account security. By integrating real-world, in-
person verification with a robust cryptographic and
economic framework, BUBIWOT aims to provide a se-
cure, censorship-resistant, and user-centric system for
identity attestation and account recovery.

Overview

BUBIWOT is designed to achieve the following core
objectives:
• Facilitate in-real-life (IRL) peer-to-peer identity
attestations.
• Enable cryptographic, decentralized account re-
covery.
• Distribute Universal Basic Income (UBI) tokens
backed by staked Bitcoin.
• Provide a yield-bearing native token (BUBI) that
captures a share of network fees.
• Enable a decentralized, value-ranked content and
communication platform.
• Ensure robust security and censorship resistance.
• Provide economic incentives to foster honest par-
ticipation and disincentivize malicious behavior.

Technical Architecture

The BUBIWOT ecosystem is a self-hosting stack de-
signed for sovereignty, where users govern the proto-
col's evolution. It is composed of four primary, inter-
connected layers:

1. The BUBIWOT Appchain: A sovereign, application-
specific blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK
and secured by Bitcoin via the Babylon proto-
col. It serves as the ultimate settlement layer,
hosting core modules for accounts, governance,
and CosmWasm smart contracts, and features an
encrypted mempool to mitigate front-running.
2. The Smart Contract Layer: The logical core
of the protocol, built with CosmWasm in Rust.
These contracts form the on-chain "constitution,"
managing user identity (the bubi-hub), a robust
governance module with private ZK-voting, a de-
veloper economy with staked code reviews, and
an ENS-like on-chain registry (resolver-contract)
that maps human-readable names to decentral-
ized infrastructure endpoints.
3. The In-Browser P2P Client: A multi-layered
sovereign portal built with web technologies (Type-
Script, CosmJS, LibP2P, Nostr). It abstracts
away key management complexity and orches-
trates communication across three distinct lay-
ers: an Appchain Service for on-chain transac-
tions, a Nostr-based Social Service for discovery
and signaling, and a LibP2P-based Private Ser-
vice for secure, end-to-end encrypted data ex-
change like recovery shares.
4. Off-Chain Validator Services: Critical infras-
tructure operated by the appchain's validators
and other permissionless actors. Their role is
expanded beyond consensus to include hosting
the commons: operating a Threshold Signature
Scheme (TSS) for the Bitcoin treasury, pinning
the protocol's source code and user content on
decentralized storage, and running services for
verifiable builds and on-chain auctions, creating
a fully self-sustaining ecosystem.

Account Recovery via Bottom-Up Secret Sharing

The account recovery process is redesigned around a
powerful cryptographic primitive known as Bottom-Up
Secret Sharing (BUSS), as detailed in the ANARKey
paper. This eliminates complex on-chain state man-
agement in favor of a more secure and efficient two-
phase, primarily off-chain process. This process con-
sists of a one-time backup phase and a recovery phase.

4.1

Phase 1: One-Time Key Backup

This is an off-chain setup process performed by the
user's client to generate and store public recovery data.
1.  **Guardian Selection:** The user selects a set of guardians and a recovery threshold (`t+1`) in their client.
2.  **Off-Chain Share Generation:** The user's client requests a "share" from each guardian over the P2P network. Each guardian's client uses its own secret key to deterministically compute a unique share for the user and sends it back. Guardians do not store this share.
3.  **Public Data Creation:** The user's client combines its own secret key with the shares from its guardians to define a secret polynomial. It then computes a set of public points from this polynomial. This is the **public recovery data**.
4.  **On-Chain Storage:** The user submits a sin-
gle transaction to store this public recovery data
in the BUBIWOT smart contract, permanently
linking it to their account.

4.2

Phase 2: Account Recovery

When a user loses their device, they use their new de-
vice to perform the following off-chain reconstruction.
1.  **Data Retrieval:** The user's client fetches the
public recovery data from the smart contract.
2.  **Share Re-computation:** The user contacts the
required threshold of guardians (`t+1`). The guardians
perform the exact same deterministic computa-
tion as before to re-generate the exact same shares
and send them to the user.
3.  **Key Reconstruction:** The user's client com-
bines the public data points with the newly re-
ceived guardian shares. This is enough informa-
tion to perfectly reconstruct the original secret
polynomial and compute the original secret key.
The user's account is now recovered without any
complex on-chain voting or session management.

Cryptographic and Economic
Foundations

The security of the BUBIWOT protocol rests on sev-
eral key pillars:
• IRL Web of Trust: The protocol is founded on
an economic web of trust. Security doesn't rely
on technically proving an in-person meeting, but
on the principle that guardians are economically
liable for their attestations. This foundation sup-
ports a novel Bottom-Up Secret Sharing scheme,
allowing for cryptographic key backup among trusted,
dynamically managed peers. To prevent cas-
cading failures (the "domino effect" where
recovering one user's key could lead to the
compromise of another), users who choose
to act as guardians use a dedicated, sep-
arate "guardian key" for recovery opera-
tions. This isolates a user's guardian du-
ties from their personal account key. This
advanced security architecture is managed
seamlessly by the BUBIWOT client, which
abstracts away the complexity of handling
multiple keys. For the user, the experi-
ence remains simple and unified, without
the burden of manually managing separate
keys. Loss of this guardian key does not
result in a loss of the user's own funds, but
it does prevent them from helping others
in recovery until the key is rotated or re-
covered.
• BUBIWOT Smart Contracts on a Sovereign
Appchain: The core logic runs in smart con-
tracts on the BUBIWOT Appchain, a sovereign
blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK. This ap-
pchain uses the Babylon protocol to anchor its
security to Bitcoin. The smart contracts func-
tion as a decentralized and immutable bulletin
board for storing the public recovery data re-
quired by the BUSS scheme, while also manag-
ing the protocol's economic incentives, on-chain
Sybil penalties, and content pointers for the so-
cial platform.
• Trust-Minimized BTC Distribution: The
protocol can programmatically distribute Bitcoin
rewards and network fees from a protocol-owned
vault. This vault is secured by a Threshold Sig-
nature Scheme (TSS) operated by the BUBIWOT
appchain's own validator set, removing single points
of failure and allowing smart contracts to safely
trigger BTC payouts.
• Strong-form Proof-of-Personhood via a User-
Defined Web of Trust: BUBIWOT establishes
a robust, scalable method for identity validation
by putting the user in control of their own web of
trust. Instead of relying on a single, rigid boot-
strapping event, the protocol's integrity is an-
chored in a flexible, user-defined policy system.
Each user defines their own on-chain Account-
Policy, specifying the criteria an attestor must
meet to vouch for their humanity and confer the
is_human_verified status. This policy can require
a minimum reputation score, a minimum amount
of staked BUBI, or that the attestor must al-
ready be a verified human. The protocol sup-
ports highly granular and composable rules (e.g.,
requiring attestations from a specific group of
friends combined with high-reputation strangers),
allowing users to dynamically use their social graph
as a security feature. This creates a flexible, user-
sovereign trust graph that scales globally. New
users can set lenient policies to get bootstrapped
into the network by early adopters, while estab-
lished users can enforce stringent policies to max-
imize their security. While in-person (IRL) meet-
ings are a powerful attestation method, they are
not a protocol requirement; the system's secu-
rity derives from the economic and reputational
liability of attestors, governed by the recipient's
own policy. To help users navigate these
powerful options, the BUBIWOT client pro-
vides wizard-driven tools to create poli-
cies based on an intuitive security levels
(e.g., "Basic", "Enhanced", "Maximum"),
along with simulations to visualize the ef-
fects of different policy choices.
• Secure Software Supply Chain: The proto-
col ensures that users run community-approved
code through a trust-minimized deployment pipeline.
All software updates are subject to a staked gov-
ernance vote that bundles the source code com-
mit hash with a verifiable, deterministic build
hash of the client application. This single-proposal
process prevents drift between approved code and
deployed applications, and it is secured by a net-
work of bonded "builders" who are slashed for
submitting fraudulent builds.

Economic Incentives

The economic model is designed to align participant
interests with the security and integrity of the network.
• Users stake Bitcoin on the L1 blockchain via the
Babylon protocol to participate.
• **Productive BUBI Token:** Holding BUBI tokens entitles the user to claim a proportional share of the network's accumulated Bitcoin fees, making it a productive, yield-bearing asset. **The protocol captures value from two primary streams: 1) BTC yield from Babylon staking rewards, and 2) BUBI-denominated network fees. To convert these BUBI fees into a distributable asset, the protocol utilizes a decentralized, on-chain batch auction system, periodically selling the accumulated fees for Bitcoin. This creates a robust, self-sufficient economic loop without relying on external price oracles or centralized exchanges.**
• Guardian attestations are incentivized through
rewards in both Bitcoin and the protocol's native
token. **Beyond one-time attestation rewards, guardians are compensated for ongoing liveness and availability. Users can trigger periodic reward distributions to their active guardians, funded by a portion of network revenue, creating a durable incentive for maintaining a healthy and responsive recovery network.** Bitcoin rewards are distributed from a decentralized, protocol-owned vault controlled by the BUBIWOT validator set via a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS).
• To deter malicious behavior, slashing penalties
are imposed on guardians who act dishonestly.
• **UBI is distributed via a user-initiated "pull" model. Verified humans can claim their accrued BUBI tokens at any time, which are newly minted upon claim. To ensure economic stability and a predictable emission schedule, the protocol implements a dynamic claim rate, limiting the total amount of UBI that can be claimed per period based on the overall network health and number of verified participants. This aligns token emission directly with active participation while preventing sudden inflation.**

Risk Analysis and Mitigation

BUBIWOT anticipates several potential threats and
proactively implements safeguards:

7.1

Collusion Among Guardian Peers

Threat: Multiple guardians might conspire to mali-
ciously control or recover a user's account.
Mitigation: Users set customizable multi-attestation
thresholds, a quorum of guardians for any critical ac-
tion. The cryptographic scheme ensures that fewer
than the threshold number of guardians have zero in-
formation about the user's key. Furthermore, the
risk of a cascading "domino effect" is mitigated
by having users who opt-in to be guardians use
a dedicated guardian key. This key separation
is an advanced security feature managed by the
client to prevent user burden while isolating a
guardian's duties from their personal account.
While loss of this key doesn't impact their own
funds, it is a critical piece of their participa-
tion in the social web of trust, and the protocol
provides a mechanism for its recovery and ro-
tation. The ability to dynamically replace guardians
via a time-locked transaction further reduces long-term
collusion risk.

7.2

Sybil Attacks

Threat: Malicious actors attempt to create numerous
fraudulent identities to manipulate UBI distribution.
Mitigation: The protocol features a two-level defense
system.
*   **Level 1: Automated On-Chain Penalties.** The protocol's primary defense is economic. By
requiring staked BTC and making guardians financially liable for their attestations, BUBIWOT
creates a powerful disincentive against approving fake accounts. Should a Sybil account be iden-
tified, it is automatically penalized on-chain by having its BUBI tokens confiscated and reputa-
tion destroyed. The guardians who attested for the Sybil are also penalized, reinforcing the web
of trust.
*   **Level 2: Bitcoin-Grade Consensus Security.** For catastrophic, large-scale attacks that
threaten the protocol's integrity, BUBIWOT inherits Bitcoin's security via the Babylon protocol. If malicious actors attempt to attack the BUBIWOT appchain itself (e.g., by double-signing blocks to revert penalties), their actions constitute a BFT consensus violation. Babylon's protocol is designed to detect such violations, which automatically reveals the attackers' private keys. This allows anyone to submit a transaction to the Bitcoin network to slash the attackers' staked Bitcoin, providing a crucial backstop that secures the BUBIWOT chain's state and its enforcement of penalties.

7.3

Loss of Devices or Keys

Threat: Accidental key loss jeopardizes user accounts
and staked funds.
Mitigation: Robust social recovery is achieved via the cryptographic **Bottom-Up Secret Sharing** scheme. By retrieving public data from the smart contract and collecting deterministic shares from a threshold of guardians, a user can securely reconstruct their original key on a new device. **To reduce the friction of real-time coordination, the protocol supports an asynchronous share-provisioning mechanism. Guardians can periodically attest to their liveness by pre-authorizing encrypted recovery components, which can be stored ephemerally on a decentralized network. This allows a user in recovery to aggregate the necessary components without requiring every guardian to be simultaneously online.** Crucially, this recovered key is the same key that controls the user's staked Bitcoin on the L1, ensuring that the primary economic stake is protected by the social recovery mechanism.

7.4

Guardian Unresponsiveness & P2P Disruption

Threat: A user's recovery may be stalled or blocked
if their guardians are offline, have lost their keys, or
refuse to cooperate.
Mitigation: The protocol implements a multi-layered
approach to ensure guardian availability.
*   **Off-Chain Liveness Signaling:** The BUBIWOT client can use the Nostr protocol for light-
weight, off-chain "heartbeats." Guardians can pe-
riodically publish a signed Nostr event to signal
their activity. This provides a real-time social
signal of liveness that helps users monitor the
health of their guardians without incurring on-
chain fees.
*   **On-Chain Guardian Replacement:** A user
can initiate a formal, time-locked replacement
process on the BUBIWOT appchain at any time.
This provides a definitive, trust-minimized mech-
anism to maintain a healthy and active set of
guardians, ensuring recovery is always possible.
The time-lock ensures the existing guardian has
a window to observe the pending change.
*   **Guardian Key Management:** The protocol
includes a process for guardians to manage their
own dedicated guardian key. If a guardian loses
or wishes to rotate their key, they can initiate
an on-chain action, authorized by their primary
account key, to set a new guardian key. This en-
sures guardians can maintain their trusted sta-
tus and ability to help others without needing to
completely re-establish their social connections.
*   **Decentralized Social Platform:** The protocol
powers a censorship-resistant social media ecosys-
tem. Users publish content (e.g., posts, replies)
to decentralized Nostr relays for real-time com-
munication. The BUBIWOT smart contracts store
immutable, on-chain pointers to this content.
For long-term persistence and enhanced
data sovereignty, users can opt to pay a
small fee to have important content archived
to a durable, content-addressed storage net-
work (e.g., IPFS). This fee directly funds
the network of validators and pinning ser-
vices that guarantee storage, creating a
sustainable and incentive-aligned model for
data permanence. This unique hybrid de-
sign combines the speed of Nostr with the
verifiable durability of paid decentralized
storage, enabling a scalable social platform where
content can be ranked and filtered by value (do-
nated BUBI), creating a rich, user-curated atten-
tion economy.
• Durable Identity and Reputation: Users establish cryptographic proof-of-personhood through
IRL attestations. This strong-form identity supports decentralized access control, reputation building, and social recovery, enhancing digital sovereignty.
• **Integrated Bug Bounties and Veri-
fiable Reviews:** To secure the protocol's evolution, the developer econ-
omy moves beyond simple staked reviews. The sys-
tem includes an integrated bug bounty program,
allowing reviewers to earn significant rewards
for identifying verifiable on-chain bugs. Gov-
ernance can then confirm these findings, re-
warding the diligent reviewer and slashing the
stakes of those who negligently approved the
flawed code. This creates a powerful, objective, and
incentive-aligned system for securing the codebase.

Use Cases

The BUBIWOT protocol is designed to support a wide
variety of essential human interactions through secure,
decentralized technology:
• Banking and UBI: Users can securely send
and receive BUBI tokens on the appchain. Cru-
cially, holding BUBI tokens allows users to claim
a proportional share of the network's BTC rev-
enues, creating a sustainable yield. **The protocol programmatically captures its own BUBI-denominated transaction fees and auctions them for BTC through a transparent, on-chain market mechanism.** The resulting BTC is then made available to BUBI holders, distributed via a trust-minimized TSS vault controlled by the appchain's validators.
• **Decentralized Authentication (Human-Verified OAuth):** BUBIWOT can serve as a decentral-
ized authentication layer for both Web2 and Web3 applications. External services can post on-chain,
incentivized "attestation requests" which any user
can fulfill by providing a cryptographic signa-
ture. A Web2 service can prompt a user to sign
a challenge message and offer a BUBI reward,
which is held in escrow by the smart contract.
Upon successful signature verification on-chain,
the user receives the reward, and the Web2 ser-
vice receives a verifiable proof of authentication.
This creates a powerful, Sybil-resistant alterna-
tive to traditional login systems, backed by real
economic incentives.
• **Decentralized Social Platform:** The protocol
powers a censorship-resistant social media ecosys-
tem. Users publish content (e.g., posts, replies)
to decentralized Nostr relays for real-time com-
munication. The BUBIWOT smart contracts store
immutable, on-chain pointers to this content.
For long-term persistence and enhanced
data sovereignty, users can opt to pay a
small fee to have important content archived
to a durable, content-addressed storage net-
work (e.g., IPFS). This fee directly funds
the network of validators and pinning ser-
vices that guarantee storage, creating a
sustainable and incentive-aligned model for
data permanence. This unique hybrid de-
sign combines the speed of Nostr with the
verifiable durability of paid decentralized
storage, enabling a scalable social platform where
content can be ranked and filtered by value (do-
nated BUBI), creating a rich, user-curated atten-
tion economy.
• **Durable Identity and Reputation:** Users es-
tablish cryptographic proof-of-personhood through
IRL attestations. This strong-form identity sup-
ports decentralized access control, reputation build-
ing, and social recovery, enhancing digital sovereignty.
• **Self-Sustaining Developer Economy:** BUBIWOT fosters a vibrant ecosystem for its own
evolution. Any user can create a BUBI-
denominated bounty to fund new features
or bug fixes. Developers can then claim
these bounties via governance-approved code
proposals. To secure this process, the sys-
tem includes staked code reviews and an
integrated bug bounty program. Review-
ers who approve code are rewarded but
are slashed if a bug is later discovered and
reported through governance by another
user. This rewards diligent reviewers, pe-
nalizes negligent ones, and creates a pow-
erful, objective, and incentive-aligned sys-
tem for advancing the codebase.
• **Real-Time Social Consensus and Attention
Economy:** The P2P client layer enables real-
time flagging and voting on peer interactions,
creating a dynamic social consensus layer. Users
can attach micropayments (in BUBI) to mes-
sages or actions to incentivize others' attention,
fostering a vibrant, responsive, and economically
sustainable social graph.

Tokenomics and Distribution

The economic sustainability of BUBIWOT is reinforced
through carefully structured tokenomics:
• Total Supply and Emission: A clearly de-
fined total supply with a predictable emission
model. New tokens are minted exclusively when
verified users actively claim their Universal Ba-
sic Income (UBI). This "pull" mechanism ensures
that supply expansion is directly tied to user en-
gagement. **To maintain stability, the emission rate is dynamically adjusted based on network growth and activity, ensuring a predictable and sustainable token supply.**
• Initial Distribution: Tokens are distributed
primarily through verified IRL attestations and
UBI claims, rewarding users for onboarding au-
thentic peers and actively participating in the
network.
• Incentives and Penalties: Guardians and val-
idators earn tokens for truthful participation, while
dishonest behavior is economically disincentivized
through slashing mechanisms tied directly to staked
Bitcoin collateral.
• Token Utility and Demand: The BUBI token
possesses deep utility. It functions as a medium
of exchange in the protocol's attention economy,
a reputation marker, and most importantly, a
yield-bearing asset that grants holders a claim
on the network's BTC-denominated fees. This
creates a powerful and sustainable demand driver.

Conclusion

The BUBIWOT protocol establishes an innovative and
decentralized framework for identity management. By
leveraging the security of the Bitcoin network, the trust
inherent in real-world relationships, and a system of in-
centivized human participation, BUBIWOT provides a
robust, scalable, and secure solution for identity vali-
dation. This positions it as a foundational technology
for global-scale UBI distribution and secure, decentral-
ized account management.
